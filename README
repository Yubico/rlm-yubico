rlm_yubikey
===========

FreeRADIUS module for using YubiKeys for authentication.

Introduction
------------

This is a rlm_perl based module for FreeRadius that allows adding
authentication by YubiKey OTP (One Time Password). It works in addition
to existing authentication methods, such as username and password. A 
YubiKey OTP can be passed by appending it either to the username or the
password. When possible, rlm_yubikey will use an Access-Challenge response 
to query the user for an OTP if one is required but not provided.

Installation
------------

 * Run 'make install'
 * Edit /etc/freeradius/modules/perl:
   - Set module = /usr/share/rlm_yubikey/rlm_yubikey.pl
 * Edit /etc/freeradius/sites-available/default:
   - Add "perl" (without quotes) to a line by itself in the "authorize" 
     section. It needs to occur early on, at least before "files".
   - Add "perl" to a line by itself in the "post-auth" section.
 * Edit /etc/freeradius/dictionary:
   - Add the following line:
     $INCLUDE        /usr/share/rlm_yubikey/dictionary

Configuration
-------------

Place configuration in /etc/yubico/rlm/ykrlm-config.cfg
Place username -> YubiKey mappings in /etc/yubico/rlm/ykmapping

Any changes to configuration will require a rull restart of freeradius 
to take effect. Even though freeradius supports reloading configuration
without restarting (by sending a HUP signal), rlm_perl, which is used 
by rlm_yubikey, does not.

**NOTE**: When running freeRADIUS (< 2.1.12) on a Debian based system, 
you need  to preload Perl libraries for rlm_yubikey to work. This can 
be done by running freeRADIUS using the following command (change the 
version to match your Perl installation):

  LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libperl.so.5.10 freeradius

Dependencies
------------

rlm_yubikey requires the following Perl modules:
AnyEvent::Yubico
Crypt::CBC
Digest::
Error::
Crypt::Blowfish

FreeRADIUS is also required.
